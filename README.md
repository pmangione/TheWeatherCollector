# The Weather Collector
As a meteorologist, I have always received many inquiries about past weather data.  For example, how much did it rain at my address back on June 2, 2017? I found that this question was not that easy to answer online.  Therefore, in 2012, I built and launched my website The Weather Collector, http://www.theweathercollector.com/

This website frequently receives over 10 thousand visits a month.  Users include property managers with snow removal disputes, lawyers for slip and fall cases, and cities/towns tracking snow removal budgets. It is also sometimes used for research in for studies buy universities and city and town governments.  An example of this is the following study from the state of Connecticut. The Weather Collector mention is on page 23.

I did most of the coding and development for this website including: 

•	Using Python, wrote automated scripts which transfer weather data in text files on a FTP server into a hosted MySQL database.
•	Using PHP and JavaScript, built interactive pages which map weather data using Google Maps.

Because The Weather Collector is an active business, the code is not available for public viewing.  However, please email me at pmangione39@hotmail.com if you would like me to walk you through some examples.
